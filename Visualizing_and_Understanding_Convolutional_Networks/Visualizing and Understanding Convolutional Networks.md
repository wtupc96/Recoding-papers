# Visualizing and Understanding Convolutional Networks

- **Existing problem:**
  - Large Convolutional Network models have recently demonstrated impressive classification performance on the ImageNet benchmark. However there is no clear understanding of why they perform so well, or how they might be improved.
- **Main idea:**
  - The visualization technique we propose uses a multi-layered Deconvolutional Network to project the feature activations back to the input pixel space.
