# CNN Features off-the-shelf: an Astounding Baseline for Recognition

- **Main Idea:**
  - SIFT and HOG descriptors produced big performance gains a decade ago and now deep *convolutional features* are providing a similar breakthrough for recognition.
  - Thus, applying the well-established computer vision procedures on CNN representations should potentially push the reported results even further.
  - *Extract an image feature vector from the `OverFeat` network and combine this with just <u>a simple linear classifier.</u>*
