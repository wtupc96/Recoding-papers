# Return of the Devil in the Details: Delving Deep into Convolutional Nets

- Main Ideaï¼š
  - We focus on methods to construct *image representations, i.e.* encoding functions $\phi$ mapping an image *I* to a vector $\phi(I)\in R^d$ suitable for analysis **with a linear classifier**, such as an SVM.
  - And consider three scenarios: <u>shallow image representations</u>, <u>deep representations pre-trained on outside data</u>, and <u>deep representation pre-trained and then find-tuned on the target dataset.</u>
